V2.0b5: 1999/03/XX
==================

-chroot-function. This is about to change to something that (a) doesn't
 require root-privs and (b) only affects the file selection dialogs.
-Several new commandline options for setting default playingmode, 
 wether to have a mixer or not, wether to start playing / quiting 
 automagically or not, etc.
-Compiles on OpenBSD/alpha, FreeBSD(2.2.8), Linux/alpha too.
-Built-in mixer support! (also, nmixer is distributed as an integrated 
 package with mp3blaster. This is the very same mixer as used in mp3blaster,
 but then as a separate binary!)
-When a new group is added, it is now automatically selected too.
 (it used to select the new group but displayed the wrong one)
-The .lst extension is no longer automagically added when writing a playlist.
-It recognizes 48Khz sampled mp3's now! (instead of crashing om them)
 However, it doesn't synchronise yet (which is necessary if the mp3 is
 slightly corrupted at some point - then again: Get only good quality MP3's!)
 Hmm..this actually appears to be a feature, not a bug :) The mpegsoundlib
 supports variable bitrate mp3's.
-The command-line syntax is changed becuz I use getopt now to 
 process arguments. If you have getopt.h, it supports meaningful long
 arguments (--blabla instead of -b) too.
-No more reports about sigsegv's unrelated to weird mp3 formats.
-No mp3's discovered that could not be played by mp3blaster. (only some
 mp3's with glitches in them that causes mp3blaster to stop playing them)

V2.0b4: 1999/01/21
==================

-Option -l supported now
-Warnings will not wait for a key to be pressed, but stay onscreen for 2
 seconds instead.
-default playmode changed to playing all songs in given order instead of
 random order.
-Redesigned structure of this package so it uses autoconf & automake to
 the max. (if you code for some UNIX-flavour, use these programs! It's a bit
 tough getting used to, but when you get the hang of it, it makes life so much
 easier!!)
-Fixed bug that caused screen to be blank after a warning-message about illegal
 mp3 filenames.
-There seems to be some nasty bug somewhere causing sigsegv. It seems to be
 fixed, but I don't have a clue what has fixed it. If you run into segv's (and
 not because you play some weird-format mp3's!!) please mention it to me and
 what you did to get it. It could be that these segv's were caused because I
 had 10 different distributions of ncurses scattered on my system but I'm just
 not sure.

V2.0b3: 1998/04/07
==================

-Now accepts as first (and only) argument a filename that points to an mp3.
 This mp3 will then be played and afterwards the program exits. 
 /* TODO
 Also, -l <filename> can be given as the first 2 arguments, which will make
 mp3blaster load a playlist pointed to by filename. (TODO: start playing
 optional)
 */

V2.0b2: 1997/12/12
==================

-Instead of using function-keys in the selection menu, you can also use
 numeric keys (for [x-]terminals that either do not support function-keys
 or use them for other purposes)
-The progress bar is now updated so people with B/W terminals can see it as
 well.

V2.0b1: 1997/12/06
==================

Large parts of code have been redone and written in C++ instead of plain C.
The interface while playing has changed entirely and should be more user-
friendly.

V1.0.1: 1997/09/29
==================

The code for keyboard input handling has been changed. Effectively nothing
has been changed concerning the interface though. Soon however this new code
will allow the playlist that's currently being played to be shown on-screen
and it can be scrolled.

V1.0.0: 1997/09/07
==================

This is the very first version I considered worthy distributing. Most major
features I planned have actually be implemented now though there's still a
lot of room for improvement..but since I like to get opinions from other 
people who use it I released it. Some changes since the previous version:

-Loading a playlist now is possible, though it can only load it's own generated
 playlists. If you already have playlists that are nothing more than a list
 of filenames(+paths!) of *.mp3-files (mp2 not yet supported) then you can try
 to insert 1 line at the top of the file reading: "GROUPNAME: Default" 
 (without the double quotes).
-Problems with file-selection fixed. File-selection should be pretty reliable
 now.
-cosmetic bug-fixes (mostly text that could be written past a boundary)

V0.9.5.1: 1997/09/07
--------------------

Fixed a bug that caused selected items following a deleted item to shift up one
item.

V0.9.5: 1997/09/07
------------------

Added pageup/pagedown support for sw_window selection windows.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.4: 1997/09/04
------------------

Recursive file selection added.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.3.1: 1997/09/01
--------------------

Directories are now alphabetically sorted.

V0.9.3: 1997/08/31
------------------

When you select files and change directory afterwards before adding the files
to the current group they won't be lost (as before) but stored and added to 
the group-window when you press F1(add files)

V0.9.2: 1997/08/26
------------------

'Select all' feature changed into 'invert selection' feature.

V0.9.1: 1997/08/25
------------------

'Select all' feature built in for the file selection window.

V0.9.0: 1997/08/22
------------------

This is the first 'working' version that can play mp3's in group in any random
order, etc. It's still not ready to be released because of lacking features that
make the program so much better than all those others :)
