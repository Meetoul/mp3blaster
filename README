------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of MP3Blaster is only tested on a linux box using kernel 2.0.27
and above, with an Intel processor. It *might* just work on other platforms
with some changing. I'm working on it but if you are willing to do please tell
me! 

There's no manual or built-in help yet, but I hope the interface is intuitive
enough to get you going. There are some keys that are not listed in the program
you might like:

-ENTER:
    If you press enter when an mp3 is highlighted the mp3 will be played.
    If a directory is highlighted while selecting files, it will change to
    that dir.
-SPACE:
    While playing MP3's it will stop playing the current MP3. (so 
    effectively it's the same as pressing F1)
	If not playing MP3's it will select a file to be added to the playlist
	when you're in the file-selection menu. It highlights an mp3 too when you
	are not selecting files, but currently that doesn't influence anything.
-'p' :
    Same as F2 during MP3 playback (pause)
-CURSOR KEYS:
    Moves around the highlighted bar.
