------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information about compiling and installing MP3Blaster on your system is listed
in the file called 'INSTALL'.

This version of MP3Blaster is tested on a linux box using kernel 2.2.0-pre7
and above, with an Intel processor. It will probably work on other platforms
with some changing. I'm working on it but if you are willing to do please tell
me! 

There's no manual or built-in help yet, but I hope the interface is intuitive
enough to get you going. There are some keys that are not listed in the program
you might like:

-ENTER:
    If you press enter when an mp3 is highlighted the mp3 will be played.
    If a directory is highlighted while selecting files, it will change to
    that dir.
-SPACE:
    While playing MP3's it will stop playing the current MP3 and skip to the
	next song in the playlist.
	If not playing MP3's it will select a file to be added to the playlist
	when you're in the file-selection menu. It highlights an mp3 too when you
	are not selecting files, but currently that doesn't do anything.
-'q' :
    Leaves MP3Blaster or leaves the playing interface (blue screen)
-CURSOR KEYS:
    Moves around the highlighted bar in selection mode 
-'1' - '10': They act like their respectively numbered function-keys, in case 
 the function-keys do not work or are mapped to do something else in your
 windowmanager.
