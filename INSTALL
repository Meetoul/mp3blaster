INSTALL

Installation is a piece of cake, thanks to autoconf & automake.
Tip: First upgrade to libncurses-4.0 or better. Version 3.* of ncurses is 
no good and will probably mess up the layout *and* perhaps some functionality.

Now on with the show..

If your distribution is GLIBC2 (libc6)-based:

./configure
make
make install

And you're ready :)

If you want more info on configure, try ./configure --help.

If you *DONT* have GLIBC2: Upgrade!! 
I have compiled it on a libc5 box too.. The only problem was that
this box (which has libc5 as default linking library) also had libc6
installed, including libpthread. If one tries to compile a program it 
would use libc5 with the libpthread from libc6, resulting in mp3blaster
linked against 2 libc's...not really a good idea. 2 Solutions: 
configure without pthread-lib (./configure --with-pthread=no), or install
a pthread-lib for libc5 and link against that.

Any comments, ideas, praises, bugreports and cheques => EMAIL brama@stack.nl.
Check http://www.stack.nl/~brama/mp3blaster.html for the latests updates, or
visit ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/sound/players where you
probably found this file anyway.

Platforms that are known to compile mp3blaster out-of-the-box:
Linux/ix86 (libc5 & libc6)
FreeBSD (2.2.8) (NOTE: You might need to install or upgrade ncurses since 
 this appears not to be installed by many people using FreeBSD)
OpenBSD/Alpha (compiled, didn't test playing cuz sounddevice wasn't working)
Linux/Alpha

If you have an SGI Indy eating dust and you don't have a use for it; I'm 
interested in one!
