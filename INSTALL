INSTALL

Installation is a piece of cake, thanks to autoconf & automake.

HOWEVER!!!

!!! Some systems using libc6 might need their /usr/include/__math.h patched.
!!! If mp3blaster compiles, but gives a segmentation fault on all mp3's you
!!! try to play with it, apply the file named 'patch' in this directory
!!! in the /usr/include-directory as root like this:
!!! 
!!! cp patch /tmp ; cd /usr/include ; patch -p0 < /tmp/patch
!!! 
!!! This patch changes one line in __math.h (line 297 for the curious amongst
!!! us, it appears the cast on this line is buggy)
!!! If someone can explain what exactly causes this bug (I can't reproduce
!!! it in any other code), please tell me!!!!
!!! Don't forget to recompile mp3blaster after this patch ;)

Now on with the show..

If your distribution is GLIBC2 (libc6)-based:

./configure
make
make install

And you're ready :)

If you want more info on configure, try ./configure --help.

If you *DONT* have GLIBC2: Upgrade!! 
I have compiled it on a libc5 box too.. The only problem was that
this box (which has libc5 as default linking library) also had libc6
installed, including libpthread. If one tries to compile a program it 
would use libc5 with the libpthread from libc6, resulting in mp3blaster
linked against 2 libc's...not really a good idea. 2 Solutions: 
configure without pthread-lib (./configure --with-pthread=no), or install
a pthread-lib for libc5 and link against that.

probably found this file anyway.

Platforms that are known to compile mp3blaster out-of-the-box:
Linux/ix86 (libc5 & libc6)
FreeBSD (2.2.8)
OpenBSD/Alpha (compiled, didn't test playing cuz sounddevice wasn't working)
Linux/Alpha
