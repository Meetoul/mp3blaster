------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install MP3Blaster on your system, you will need a few more packages,
all of which you can find on my homepage (http://www.stack.nl/~brama/).
These are:

-linuxthreads (libpthreads-library for linux)
-splay-0.5 (only the mpegsound-lib from this program is used)

Unpack these files in the same dir as the archive this file was in, then change
to the mp3blaster directory.
Check the Makefile to adjust the settings for your system, although they are
probably okay the way they are. 

First, make and install the libpthreads-package. The library you've now 
installed should be in the default library-path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH). If it is
installed in /usr/local/lib, that's okay too since that's already being looked
after by the Makefile. If it does not, make sure the path to it is present in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable!

Now make the splay-0.5 package (see its INSTALL file), since this program
needs the library that will be produced by its configure script.
You don't have to build the entire splay-package. If you only want to be able
to use MP3Blaster, go to the splay-0.5 dir and do:

./configure --with-pthreads
cd mpegsound
make

The mpegsound library should be compiled now.

To build mp3blaster change to this directory (mp3blaster-VERSION) and do:

make
make install (as root, or as user if you changed the paths in the makefile to
              point to your homedir)

If everything went alright, you should be able to run the player now by typing
'mp3blaster' on your command prompt. (it's a good idea to link this file to
something shorter like 'mp3play', with the command 'ln -sf mp3blaster mp3play'
in the right dir)
See 'README' for additional help on the program.
