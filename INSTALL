------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have GLIBC2 (libc6) installed on your system, you need an
older version of mp3blaster (mp3blaster-2.0b2 or earlier), since the
newer versions use the mpegsound-lib from the splay-package which
only compiles on GLIBC2-machines. I haven't tried to get this package
to work on libc5-machines yet.. if you have GLIBC2, you only need the
mp3blaster-package and nothing more.

INSTALL

Installation is a piece of cake, thanks to autoconf & automake.
If your distribution is GLIBC2 (libc6)-based:

./configure
make
make install

And you're ready :)

If you want more info on configure, try ./configure --help.

If you *DONT* have GLIBC2: Upgrade!! Your last resort is using an older
version of mp3blaster (on my homepage, look for version 2.0b2 and lower),
but I wouldn't do that.. PS: It might be possible that this version of
mp3blaster compiles on non-GLIBC2 systems, but I don't have such a system
anymore. If you get that to work, plz. notify me.
