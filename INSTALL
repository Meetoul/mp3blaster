------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install MP3Blaster on your system, you will need a few more packages,
all of which you can find on my homepage (http://www.stack.nl/~brama/).
These are:

-linuxthreads (libpthreads-library for linux)
 http://www.stack.nl/~brama/src/linuxthreads.tar.gz OR
 ftp://mud.stack.nl/pub/linux/linuxthreads.tar.gz 

-splay-0.8 (only the mpegsound-lib from this program is used)
 http://www.stack.nl/~brama/src/splay-0.8.tar.gz OR
 ftp://mud.stack.nl/pub/linux/splay-0.8.tar.gz

From version 2.0 (including beta's) on, you don't need to install splay-0.8
yourself anymore. The source-code for the mpegsound-lib (including a
precompiled library) is now included with this package.

If you want to use threads while playing MP3's, you need to install the
linuxthreads library first (you really want to, because without threads
there is *no* buffer, so just about anything you do with your computer
while playing MP3's will interrupt the sound..). The linuxthreads (AKA
pthread-library) package can be found on my homepage, as mentioned above.
For information on how to install the pthreads-library see its own install
instructions.


ADJUSTING MAKEFILE
------------------

Check the Makefile to adjust the settings for your system, although they are
probably okay the way they are.

By default, MP3Blaster assumes you have installed the pthreads-library in
/usr/local/lib and the include-files that go with it in /usr/local/include.
If these paths are different on your system, you want to add them in the
Makefile's LIBPATHS and INCS section.  F.e. if your threads-library is
/home/foo/lib/ and the pthread.h file is in /home/foo/include, change the
'LIBPATHS=' and 'INCS=' lines in the Makefile from:

LIBPATHS=-L./lib -L/usr/local/lib
INCS=-I./include -I/usr/include/ncurses

to:

LIBPATHS=-L./lib -L/usr/local/lib -L/home/foo/lib
INCS=-I./include -I/usr/include/ncurses -I/home/foo/include


ADJUSTING MP3BLASTER.H
----------------------

This is the configuration-file for MP3Blaster. If you have a fairly common
system, you probably don't need to change anything. 

-One of the known problems is the location of the ncurses headerfiles. If,
 during compilation, you get errors that mention [n]curses in some way, try
 one of the other NCURSES defines (by commenting the default NCURSES
 define and commenting out one of the others). One of the defines should
 work! If not, please mail me the output of your compile-job.
-There's also a define called PTHREADEDMPEG. If this is not defined, the 
 pthreads-library is not used (and not required). However, I strongly
 recommend that you use this library since it will ensure a decent
 sound-output without interruptions, even if you are working a lot with
 your computer meanwhile.


INSTALLING MP3BLASTER
---------------------

-This package comes with a precompiled mpegsound-library (in /lib). If, for
 some reason, this does not work for you, get splay-0.8.tar.gz (from my
 homepage) and try to compile the mpegsound-library that comes with it. 
 (go to the splay-0.8 directory, type ./configure, enter the mpegsound/ dir,
 edit the mpegsound.h file to make the 'Mpegtoraw *server' variable in the
 Mpegfileplayer-class protected instead of private(!!), then type
 'make', and, when it compiled, cp the libmpegsound.a into the lib/ subdir
 from this package. Make sure the mpegsound-library is compiled with
 pthread-support!). When I get to use the autoconf-package with my program,
 the source for the mpegsound-lib will be included with this package.

Now, to build mp3blaster do:

make
make install (as root, or as user if you changed the paths in the makefile to
              point to your homedir)

If everything went OK, you should be able to run the player now by typing
'mp3blaster' on your shell-prompt.

See 'README' for additional help on the program.
