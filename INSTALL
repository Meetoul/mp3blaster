------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation is a piece of cake, thanks to autoconf & automake.

./configure
make
make install

cp sample.mp3blasterrc ~/.mp3blasterrc and tweak it to your likings
(if you don' have one yet)

This should suffice on most systems. If you experience problems running
mp3blaster, read these TIPS:

-If you're not using ncurses 4.2 (ls /usr/lib/libncurses*), then install
 it. Ncurses-3.* and ncurses-5.*(BETA) are no good.
-If mp3blaster gets killed with a segmentation fault, then reconfigure with
 -D__NO_MATH_INLINES (CPPFLAGS="-D__NO_MATH_INLINES" ./configure) and
 remake.

EXTRA CONFIGURE OPTIONS

--with-nas      Use this to get Network Audio System playback suport. Configure
                must be able to find libaudio.a/so and <audio/audiolib.h>.
--with-pthread  Used by default. If you don't want pthread (which is only
                used for buffering), use --without-pthread. 

Platforms that are known to compile mp3blaster out-of-the-box:
Linux/ix86 (libc5 & libc6)
FreeBSD (2.2.8) (NOTE: You might need to install or upgrade ncurses since 
 this appears not to be installed by many people using FreeBSD)
OpenBSD/Alpha (compiled, didn't test playing cuz sounddevice wasn't working)
Linux/Alpha

If you have an SGI Indy eating dust and you don't have a use for it; I'm 
interested in one! Sun SparcStations are welcome too ;-)
