        Sound 'hicks' (short interruptions) whenever another task uses I/O.
      </FONT><BR>

      This notably occurs on linux boxen with Creative's Soundblaster
      (what's in a name) Live's. A blunt, but well working, solution is to
      run mp3blaster with high priority (nice level -5 or lower). Only root
      may set a nice-level below 0, so you should either use 'renice' as
      root to set the level, or run mp3blaster as root (at your own risk).

        Listing files over a network is very slow
      </FONT><BR>

      By default, mp3blaster scans each file to find ID3 tags. Disable this
      by setting File.ID3Names to 0 in your config file.

        When playing mp3's over a network, there's a delay before each file.
      </FONT><BR>

      By default, mp3blaster reads the entire mp3 file to scan the length in
      seconds, otherwise VBR encoded mp3's will show up with the wrong song
      length. To disable this, set ScanMP3 to 1 in your config file.

        How do you get the colours and borders right in an xterm?
       </FONT><BR>

      Run xterm with -fg white -bg black, set your TERM environment variable
      to color_xterm (FreeBSD: xterm-color) and there you go!

        Mp3blaster compiles, but when I try to play an MP3, it gives a 
        segmentation fault.
       </FONT><BR>

      This happens on old linux systems with gcc-2.7.*.
      Try to recompile with compile flag -D__NO_MATH_INLINES
      (CPPFLAGS="-D__NO_MATH_INLINES" ./configure).

        Mp3blaster compiles, but it gives a segmentation fault at startup or
        shutdown.
      </FONT><BR>

      Do not link the stdc++ libraries (CXX=gcc ./configure usually
      accomplishes this; if it's a recompile don't forget to delete
      config.cache!).

      You probably have ncurses-3 installed on your system. Upgrade 
      ncurses to a recent stable version.

        I don't want mp3blaster to take up a console or xterm while
        playing.

      Install <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/"><i>screen</i></a>. Next, run
      screen, run mp3blaster, start a playlist and detach the screen. Now
      you'll have your console all to yourself again!
