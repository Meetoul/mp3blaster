				How do you get the colours and borders right in an xterm?

			Run xterm with -fg white -bg black, set your TERM environment variable
			to color_xterm (FreeBSD: xterm-color) and there you go!

			Try to recompile with compile flag -D__NO_MATH_INLINES
			(CPPFLAGS="-D__NO_MATH_INLINES" ./configure).  If this doesn't work,
			it's probably a glitch in mp3blaster, triggered by some bugged mp3's. If
			this is a repeatable crash (or if it still crashes on all mp3's) please
			email me.

			Do not link the stdc++ libraries (CXX=gcc ./configure usually
			accomplishes this; if it's a recompile don't forget to delete
			config.cache!).

			This occurs on ncurses-3.* versions (notably 3.4). Upgrading ncurses to

			No sweat. First, install <a

			screen, run mp3blaster, start a playlist and detach the screen. Now
			you'll have your console all to yourself again!
