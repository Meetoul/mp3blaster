        Sound 'hicks' (short interruptions) whenever another task uses I/O.

      This notably occurs on linux boxen with Creative's Soundblaster
      (what's in a name) Live's. A blunt, but well working, solution is to
      run mp3blaster with high priority (nice level -5 or lower). Only root
      may set a nice-level below 0, so you should either use 'renice' as
      root to set the level, or run mp3blaster as root (at your own risk).

        When playing mp3's over a network, there's a delay before each file.
      </FONT><BR>

      Mp3blaster can read the entire mp3 file to scan the length in
      seconds, so VBR encoded mp3's will show up with the correct total
      time. To disable this, set ScanMP3 to 1 in your config file. If your
			mp3's start with a XING header, the total time will be correctly read
			from there.

        How do you get the colours and borders right in an xterm?
       </FONT><BR>

      Run xterm with -fg white -bg black, set your TERM environment variable
      to xterm-color (or perhaps color_xterm). You might want to copy the
			suggested keybindings from the sample mp3blasterrc installed in
			$prefix/share/mp3blaster.

        Mp3blaster compiles, but when I try to play an MP3, it gives a 
        segmentation fault.
       </FONT><BR>

      This happens on really old linux systems with gcc-2.7.*.
      Try to recompile with compile flag -D__NO_MATH_INLINES
      (CPPFLAGS="-D__NO_MATH_INLINES" ./configure).

				The screen layout is messed up.

      You probably have ncurses-3 installed on your system. Upgrade 
      ncurses to a recent stable version.

        I don't want mp3blaster to take up a console or xterm while
        playing.
      </FONT><BR>

      Install <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/"><i>screen</i></a>. Next, run
      screen, run mp3blaster, start a playlist and detach the screen. Now
      you'll have your console all to yourself again!
