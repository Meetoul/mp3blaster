-playback device selectable from command-line/compile-time option (for OpenBSD)
-emulate popular commandline mp3 players (like mpg123/splay)
-'/' to search in scrollwin
-(downmix to 22Khz)
-(compatible with WinAmp playlist)
-(``cold start'' option)
-(add browsable playlist in playwindow)
-(add wav/http support)
-(include getopt.c/getopt.h from GNU site so all OS's support getopt_long)

-InfraRed support! (lirc)

-NAS (Network Audio System) support!!
-refresh_screen() that actually works at all times.
-fix a memory-leak. After each played song, 4kb is lost(oops) (but 
 regained if you leave the playlist by F1 :) So far I can't find anything
 causing it in my program..
-update border in refresh_screen() too
-Save playing status when program is interrupted, so the playlist can be 
 resumed when mp3blaster is restarted (useful for *big* playlists)
-On my cleanly-installed debian-2.0 linux box the blue play-window's layout
 is messed up. Probably due to the ncurses-lib on it (and perhaps because
 I do some unsupported tricks with ncurses, to work around `features' *cough*)
 Gotta look into that.. (appears to be an ncurses ``feature'')
