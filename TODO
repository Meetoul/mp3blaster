IMPORTANT
-fix broken mp3tag when using --enable-newthreads!
-working 'previous track'
-implement ID3v2 tag parsing
-'next group' keybinding

INTERESTING
-update autoconf scripts to use config.h.
-when directories are given as final cmdline args, assume recursive search of
 mp3's in that dir.
-F5/F3 in filemanager mode: instead of using currently highlighted dir, check
 if multiple dirs have been selected and use all those dirs to add mp3's instd.
-check existence of files on playlistload (and report status)
-'skip to next mp3 and delete this one from list'
-Shout/IceCast .pls support.
-show files as their id3 tag info, not filenames (optional)
 =>done, but now allow for a default viewmode too!
-save shuffle mode for main group, and playback mode for entire group in
 playlist
-read/write playlist +save tmp.playlist to continue it later. (partly done)
-import/export playlist (compatible met o.a. winamp) (fixed? might work :))
-make 'next song' skippable (could be tough, it's not a pointer to a group
 member, but just a const char *..)
-Total playlist time displayed somewhere

WHEN I'M BORED
-move all selected files in filemanager to current dir (m) (!)
-clear mpeg-info when songplay's finished.
-file viewer in filemanager.
-scrollable input in popup_win ?
-rename group->getPlayedmode() to group->randomOrder()
-change cd-style keys to have logical mappings on the numeric keypad
-pulldown menus instead of space-consuming help window!
-scrollWin class: Use a global variable to determine for each function if
                  the window needs to be refreshed. This is much more
                  userfriendly for the end user of this class!
