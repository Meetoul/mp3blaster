-http streaming
-hide cursor (again?)
-show files as their id3 tag info, not filenames (optional)
-if a song's finished in a playlist, it gets cut off because the decoding is
 done (run returns false), but the audio output isn't... FIX!
-'next group' knop
-make 'next song' skippable (could be tough, it's not a pointer to a group
 member, but just a const char *..)
-save shuffle mode for main group, and playback mode for entire group in
 playlist
-change cd-style keys to have logical mappings on the numeric keypad
-skip certain directories (e.g. '.resources' and some more..)

mp3blaster: 
Basic features:
-move all selected files in filemanager to current dir (m) (!)
-import/export playlist (compatible met o.a. winamp) (fixed? might work :))
-fix warning()
-sort order of files in groups!
-rename global playmodes to make sense 
 -Play current group, including subgroups
 -Play current group, but not its subgroups
 -Shuffle all songs from all groups (PLAY_RANDOM)
[-missing playmodes (mp3win->beingPlayed() function?)]
-clear mpeg-info when songplay's finished.
-rename group->getPlayedmode() to group->randomOrder()
-split up playmode PLAY_GROUP in 'play current group but not its subgroups' and
 'play current group including subgroups'
-read/write playlist +save tmp.playlist to continue it later. (partly done)
-scrollable input in popup_win ?

Enhanced functionality:
-'skip to next mp3 and delete this one from list'
-pulldown menus instead of space-consuming help window!

DONE:
[DONE-filesize in filemanager f/each file:]
[DONE-help in scrollwin! (separate program mode + scrollWin obj)]
[DONE-lock on group->playing/played (for deletion) + lock on group access...]
-configurable keys
-kleuren groups
-next song: clear line before drawing a new song in it
-crashes on null files.
-playmode change from group-mode to any other: BROKEN (fix: function
 reset_playlist) - can't change playmode during play anymore
-next song: update it when :user deletes mp3/group, changes playlist mode,stops
            playlist, goes back one song, ..

scrollWin class: Use a global variable to determine for each function if
                 the window needs to be refreshed. This is much more
								 userfriendly for the end user of this class!
