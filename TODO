-(Save group's playorder in playlist!)
-(compatible with WinAmp playlist)
-(play single group playmode)
-(``cold start'' option)

-InfraRed support!
-path/filename in upper border playwindow
-plugin support
-better chrooted environment
-"multiple del"
-if no mixer-device is detected, don't try to do anything with the
 mixer in playwindow.cc..
-NAS (Network Audio System) support!!
-find out why many mp3's give 'Can't make thread' near the end of the song.
 (because of  id3tag perhaps?)
-improve writing/reading of playlist code.
-refresh_screen() that actually works at all times.
-fix a memory-leak. After each played song, 4kb is lost(oops) (but 
 regained if you leave the playlist by F1 :) So far I can't find anything
 causing it in my program..
-Allowing user to change group-order (and mp3-order afterwards)
-when paused, show this on the interface.
-update border in refresh_screen() too
-Forward/Rewind while playing in relative amounts.
-Save playing status when program is interrupted, so the playlist can be 
 resumed when mp3blaster is restarted (useful for *big* playlists)
-On my cleanly-installed debian-2.0 linux box the blue play-window's layout
 is f*cked up bad. Probably due to the ncurses-lib on it (and perhaps because
 I do some unsupported tricks with ncurses, to work around `features' *cough*)
 Gotta look into that.. (appears to be an ncurses ``feature'')
