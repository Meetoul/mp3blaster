 -Write a manual or a popup-menu of [shortcut]keys in the program.
 -refresh_screen() that actually works at all times.
 -simple volume control within the program
 -fix a memory-leak. After each played song, 16kb is lost(oops) (but 
  regained if you leave the playlist by F1 :) So far I can't find anything
  causing it in my program so maybe it's the mpegsound-library I'm using..
  However, in the new 2.* version, this problem is reduced to only 4k/song or
  so. Getting better .. :-) Dunno if it's due to the fact that I use a new
  version of the mpegsound-lib or becuz of the slick *ahem* new code I wrote.
 -Allowing user to change group-order (and mp3-order afterwards)
 -Get/hack source that plays mp2's too. (22Khz 56kbit/s & some more modes)
 -when paused, show this on the interface.
 -update border in refresh_screen() too
