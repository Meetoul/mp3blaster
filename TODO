-find out why many mp3's give 'Can't make thread' near the end of the song.
 Hah. That was because the error-message was wrong. :)
-refresh_screen() that actually works at all times.
-fix a memory-leak. After each played song, 4kb is lost(oops) (but 
 regained if you leave the playlist by F1 :) So far I can't find anything
 causing it in my program..
-update border in refresh_screen() too
-Forward/Rewind while playing in relative amounts.
-Save playing status when program is interrupted, so the playlist can be 
 resumed when mp3blaster is restarted (useful for *big* playlists)
-On my cleanly-installed debian-2.0 linux box the blue play-window's layout
 is messed up. Probably due to the ncurses-lib on it (and perhaps because
 I do some unsupported tricks with ncurses, to work around `features' *cough*)
 Gotta look into that.. (appears to be an ncurses ``feature'')
