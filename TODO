 -path/filename in bovenste rand playwindow (als niet past:...../bla.mp3)
 -plugin support
 -"no mixer" support
 -chrooted environment
 -"press q to return to playlist" msg
 -init_color for mixer 
 -"multiple del"
 -if no mixer-device is detected, don't try to do anything with the
  mixer in playwindow.cc..
 -NAS (Network Audio System) support!!
 -find out why many mp3's give 'Can't make thread' near the end of the song.
  (because of  id3tag perhaps?)
 -improve writing/reading of playlist code.
 -Add support for playing wav files too
 -refresh_screen() that actually works at all times.
 -simple volume control within the program
 -fix a memory-leak. After each played song, 4kb is lost(oops) (but 
  regained if you leave the playlist by F1 :) So far I can't find anything
  causing it in my program..
 -Allowing user to change group-order (and mp3-order afterwards)
 -when paused, show this on the interface.
 -update border in refresh_screen() too
 -Don't close and reopen sound-device - better open the sound-device at
  startup and close it afterwards. Avoids irritating cracks&hisses at the
  beginning of each song played.
 -Forward/Rewind while playing in relative amounts.
 -Save playing status when program is interrupted, so the playlist can be 
  resumed when mp3blaster is restarted (useful for *big* playlists)
 -On my cleanly-installed debian-2.0 linux box the blue play-window's layout
  is fucked up bad. Probably due to the ncurses-lib on it (and perhaps because
  I do some unsupported tricks with ncurses, to work around `features' *cough*)
  Gotta look into that..
 -built-in helpmenu

DONE:
 -save path at startup for playlist reading/saving
 -be consistent about .lst extension (i.e., don't add it automagically
  when writing a playlist)
 -!! After group is added, CHANGE to the new group!! (and mention it)
  (same case after reading a playlist->update add_group code)
 -fix bug when playlist is read from a file, it doesn't display the
  correct contents for the current group
 -glibc2-compliant. (dunno if glibc1 still works)
 -Don't wait for keypress after warning/error: Just wait 1/2 seconds
 -Implemented autoconf/automake
 -Get/hack source that plays mp2's too. (22Khz 56kbit/s & some more modes)
  This problem was fixed with splay-0.8.2's mpegsound-lib.

BUGS:
 -screen clears after 'invalid filename (should end with .mp3/mp2)'
