This file contains an explanation for most commands in
mp3blaster. Please note that mp3blaster features 2 modes:
Normal Mode and File Mode. In Normal Mode you control the
playlist displayed in the main window. In File Mode, you can
browse and add files using a file manager in the main
window. You can switch between these two modes using F1
(this is the default keybinding, you can alter it in the
config file, see the mp3blaster manpage).
To see which command is mapped to which key, check the help
window on top of the screen in mp3blaster; you can browse
through this window using '-' and '+'. For most commands the
keybinding can be configured - read the mp3blaster
manpage.

Commands specific to Normal Mode:
=================================

SELECT FILES (F1)
  Enters File Mode.

ADD GROUP
  Add a group to the playlist. A group can be thought of as
  an album, or a music category. Groups can be nested
  indefinitely.

SET GROUP TITLE
  Changes the name of the group that's currently
  highlighted. You will be prompted to enter a name.

CLEAR PLAYLIST
  Whipes your entire playlist (without asking!). This will
  only work when no song is being played at invocation time.

MOVE FILES AFTER
  This will move songs that you have selected (using the
  spacebar) after the currently highlighted song in the
  playlist. You can't move songs from one group to another
  this way. Songs will be added after the song in the order
  in which you selected them.

MOVE FILES BEFORE
  As in MOVE FILES AFTER, only now songs will be added
  before the currently highlighted song.

SELECT FILE
  This will select the currently highlighted file. Selected
  items are displayed in bold (on terminals that support
  this). Selections are useful in combination with MOVE
  FILES BEFORE / AFTER, DELETE (AND MARK).

ENTER
  Depending on what your selection bar in the main window is
  highlighting, this will do:
  -If a song is highlighted:
   It will immediately play this song. If a playlist was
   being played at the time you pressed enter, it will
   continue with the next song after the selected song is
   finished.
  -If a group is highlighted:
   It will dive into the group. The special group '..' will
   take you up one group (its parent group). The 'root'
   group (the empty one at startup) has no parent group.

PREVIOUS PAGE and NEXT PAGE
  Scrolls the content of the main window resp. up or down.

MOVE SCROLLBAR UP and MOVE SCROLLBAR DOWN
  Moves the selection bar (the inverted row in the main
  window) resp. up or down one item.

Commands specific to File Mode:
===============================

ADD FILES TO LIST:
  This will exit File Mode and enter Normal Mode. All
  selected songs will be added to the playlist. Please note
  that you can select songs from multiple directories
  without having to switch back and forth between File Mode
  and Normal Mode; simply select the songs you want, change
  directories, select more songs etc. All songs will be
  added in the order in which you selected them. Songs will
  be added to the group you were in before entering File
  Mode.

INVERT SELECTION:
  All files that are selected will be unselected, and vice
  versa. Use this if you want all songs from one directory
  except for a few, by selecting the unwanted songs and then
  use this command.

RECURS. SELECT ALL
  This will search for songs in the current directory and in
  all its subdirectories, and add them to the playlist.
  After all songs have been added, mp3blaster will switch to
  Normal Mode.
  Please be careful when using this command, because it
  might take a long time if there are many subdirs (e.g.
  when the current directory is the root-directory, "/").

ADD DIRS AS GROUPS
  This is the most powerful command in mp3blaster; It works
  similar to RECURS. SELECT ALL, only in this case songs
  will be put into a group in the playlist with the same
  name as the directory they are in. Groups will not be
  nested though; all dirs that contain songs are added as a
  group in the one group you were in before entering File
  Mode. (Perhaps this might change in a future release)

ENTER NEW PATH
  This command will prompt you to enter a new directory, to
  which it will then change.

CONVERT MP3 TO WAV
  This will convert the currently highlighted mp3, or all
  selected mp3's, to *.wav files in the directory that you
  will be prompted for. The *.wav files are not zero-padded
  to be a multiple of 2352 bytes (sector-size on a cd). If
  you want to burn them to an audio-cd using cdrecord, add
  the option '-pad' (most other recording programs supply
  similar options).

ADD URL (SHOUTCAST)
  Add an URL to the playlist. This URL should be an url to a
  shoutcast server. 
  !!! Doesn't work in 3.0 prerelease..

START FILE SEARCH
  Starts search mode: In this mode, the scrollbar in the
  main window will jump to the first song it finds starting
  with the characters that you enter after starting file
  search. File search ends when you don't type any
  characters for a few seconds, or when enter is pressed.
  Please note that this search is case-sensitive.

GO UP ONE DIR
  For the lazy people amongst us: This command will simply
  go up one dir (same as hitting enter over the '..' dir).

SELECT FILE
  This will select the file under the scrollbar in the main
  window. This can be used in combination with INVERT
  SELECTION, ADD FILES TO LIST, CONVERT MP3 TO WAV.

Commands that work in any mode:
===============================

LOAD/ADD PLAYLIST
  This will put mp3blaster in File Mode (if it isn't
  already), and change to the directory where your playlists
  are stored. Playlists (*.lst by default) can be loaded
  simply by highlighting and selecting one (using enter).
  The location where your playlists are stoed is 
  the homedir of the user running it. It can be
  overridden using the keyword 'PlaylistDir' in the config
  file (man mp3blaster).

WRITE PLAYLIST
  This will save your current playlist to a file. You will
  be prompted to enter a filename. Read the description for
  LOAD/ADD PLAYLIST to see where playlists are stored.

TOGGLE REPEAT
  Toggles between repeat and no-repeat mode. In repeat mode,
  the playlist will be played again after it has been
  finished.

TOGGLE GROUPSHUFFLE
  Toggles shuffling on and off for the current group. Please
  note that this will only toggle the shuffle mode for the
  current group, and not for all groups in your playlist!
  Using this function, you can create very flexible
  playlists where some groups are always played in the order
  in which you added songs to it (e.g. albums from one
  artist), while others are shuffled (e.g. compilation
  albums where you don't want to hear the same sequence over
  and over again). If there are groups in the group for
  which you enabled shuffle mode, the order in which these
  groups are played is shuffled as well! 

TOGGLE PLAY MODE
  This toggles the global playback mode, which is shown
  directly underneath the help window with the commands.
  Possible modes are:
  -Play all songs from all groups without shuffle:
   This will play all groups and songs in the playlist in
   the order that they are shown.
  -Play all subgroups in this group:
   This will only play the groups that exist in the
   currently selected group. The order in which they are
   played is shuffled when shuffle mode is enabled for the
   current group.
  -Play all songs from all groups in random order:
   This mode ignores all shuffle settings for all groups,
   and will randomly shuffle all the songs in all the
   groups. Putting all songs in one group and enable shuffle
   mode for that group would have the same effect.
  -Only play songs from the current group:
   In this mode, only the songs (and not groups!) from the
   current group will be played. The order depends on the
   shuffle mode for this group.

START/STOP PLAYLIST
  This will start playing the playlist if it's not playing,
  and vice versa. The playback order is determined by the
  global playback mode and/or the individual shuffle
  settings for each group.

CHANGE #THREADS
  Increases the number of threads used for playback. Threads
  are used as a buffer, e.g. sound playback will be less
  likely interrupted when your machine is temporarily busy.
  The used buffering method is far from perfect though, so
  you dont' want to hog your machine much during playback..

TOGGLE MIXER DEVICE
  If your system supports the OSS mixer (or NAS mixer), it
  will be displayed on the bottom-right of the mp3blaster
  screen. This command will cycle between all the available
  mixer devices on your primary sound device. You can
  back-cycle using capital-T (these keybindings are
  currently hardcoded..)

MIXERVOLUME DOWN
  Turns down the currently selected mixer device.

MIXERVOLUME UP
  Turns up the currently selected mixed device.

QUIT MP3BLASTER
  Quits mp3blaster (Caught you by surprise, didn't it?)

SHOW HELP
  Shows this text.

DELETE
  Deletes currently highlighted or selected song(s) (or
  group) from the playlist. If you try to delete a group in
  which a song is currently being played, it will silently
  fail. Please note that this command will not try to delete
  the file, only its reference in the playlist. It will not
  save your playlist either, you have to do this yourself.

DELETE AND MARK
  This is similar to DELETE, only it will also (try to) mark
  the associated file(s) as bad, by moving them into a
  subdirectory 'baditems', located in the same directory as
  the song. 
  **********=========== BEWARE =============*************
  In contrast to the DELETE command, this command
  *will* save your playlist using as playlist file the last
  loaded playlist in this mp3blaster session.

REFRESH SCREEN
  Tries to refresh mp3blaster's layout. It likely won't
  always work for 100%, YMMV.

PREVIOUS SONG
  If playing a playlist, this will play the previous song
  (CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED!)

PLAY SONG
  If playing a playlist, this will either:
  -If a song is currently being played, it will be paused.
  -continue playing a paused song
  -If playback was stopped using the stop button, play will
   restart playback.
  If not playing a playlist, this will start the playlist.

NEXT SONG
  If playing in a playlist, this will stop the current song
  and move to the next song.

REWIND SONG
  If a song is being played, this command will jump back one
  step in the song. The size of this step can be configured
  in the config file using the keyword 'SkipFrames' (the
  larger this number is, the bigger the step).

FORWARD SONG
  Same as for REWIND SONG, only now you will jump ahead in
  the song.

STOP SONG
  If a song is being played, it will be stopped. If a
  playlist is being played, this will not reset the
  playlist, it will only mark the current song as played. If
  play is pressed after stop, the playlist will continue
  with the next song.

SCROLL UP / DOWN HELPTEXT
  Scroll the help window in the top of the screen
  (containing the keyboard shortcuts for all commands) up or
  down.
