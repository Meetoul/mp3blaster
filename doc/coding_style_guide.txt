The coding style guide from coding_style_guide.html must be followed
for all new mp3blaster code. There are a few exceptions/additions:

 * Indent with tabs rather than spaces. No whitespace must follow 
   indentation to prevent messed up layouts between different 
	 tabsettings. (will be changed to spaces only later!)
 * Line length may not exceed 80 characters, assuming a tab width of 2.
