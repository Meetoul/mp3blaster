.SH DESCRIPTION
.I NMixer 
is an interactive text-based sound-mixer control program that you can
use to set the volume of each supported mixer device of your soundcard.
It automagically detects all devices that are supported by your sound
hardware, and shows a list of scrollbars for each of these devices.
You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll though the list of
scrollbars (some do not fit on the screen, but you can reach them by
simply scrolling down at the bottom of the screen). The left and right
arrow keys change the volume for the currently highlighted device, and
(if you're lucky), you can use home/end/PgUp/PgDn on the numerical keyboard
to set left and right volume independantly. You can also use 0..5 to set
the volume to the position indicated by the numbers on top of the screen.
If nmixer is compiled with NAS (Network Audio System) support and it's called
as 'nasmixer', it will show the settings for the NAX mixer device.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B mixdev=setting
Sets a specific mixer device to the volume specified by setting. 
Example: bass=100
.TP
.B -q
Immediately quit (after the command-line specified settings are set!). This
only makes sense if you use command-line options to set volumes. (currently,
the interface is drawn while setting the mixer, and removed afterwards, which
might be annoying, but it's in the way of being changed :)
