-Check the ChangeLog file to see what's been done. (somehow, automake 
 requires this file exists.....)
-From 2.0b4 on, mp3blaster uses autoconf (and automake) to configure,
 compile and install. You don't need those packages yourself though;
 everything's just a lot easier now for you (and me).
-From 2.0b4 on, the mpegsound-library used can handle more mp3-formats. Not
 all though, yet (any mp3 that's made from a sample that's not 22/32/44Khz
 will crash mp3blaster).
