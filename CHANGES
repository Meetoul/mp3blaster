V2.0b3: 1998/04/07
==================

-Now accepts as first (and only) argument a filename that points to an mp3.
 This mp3 will then be played and afterwards the program exits. 
 /* TODO
 Also, -l <filename> can be given as the first 2 arguments, which will make
 mp3blaster load a playlist pointed to by filename. (TODO: start playing
 optional)
 */

V2.0b2: 1997/12/12
==================

-Instead of using function-keys in the selection menu, you can also use
 numeric keys (for [x-]terminals that either do not support function-keys
 or use them for other purposes)
-The progress bar is now updated so people with B/W terminals can see it as
 well.

V2.0b1: 1997/12/06
==================

Large parts of code have been redone and written in C++ instead of plain C.
The interface while playing has changed entirely and should be more user-
friendly.

V1.0.1: 1997/09/29
==================

The code for keyboard input handling has been changed. Effectively nothing
has been changed concerning the interface though. Soon however this new code
will allow the playlist that's currently being played to be shown on-screen
and it can be scrolled.

V1.0.0: 1997/09/07
==================

This is the very first version I considered worthy distributing. Most major
features I planned have actually be implemented now though there's still a
lot of room for improvement..but since I like to get opinions from other 
people who use it I released it. Some changes since the previous version:

-Loading a playlist now is possible, though it can only load it's own generated
 playlists. If you already have playlists that are nothing more than a list
 of filenames(+paths!) of *.mp3-files (mp2 not yet supported) then you can try
 to insert 1 line at the top of the file reading: "GROUPNAME: Default" 
 (without the double quotes).
-Problems with file-selection fixed. File-selection should be pretty reliable
 now.
-cosmetic bug-fixes (mostly text that could be written past a boundary)

V0.9.5.1: 1997/09/07
--------------------

Fixed a bug that caused selected items following a deleted item to shift up one
item.

V0.9.5: 1997/09/07
------------------

Added pageup/pagedown support for sw_window selection windows.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.4: 1997/09/04
------------------

Recursive file selection added.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.3.1: 1997/09/01
--------------------

Directories are now alphabetically sorted.

V0.9.3: 1997/08/31
------------------

When you select files and change directory afterwards before adding the files
to the current group they won't be lost (as before) but stored and added to 
the group-window when you press F1(add files)

V0.9.2: 1997/08/26
------------------

'Select all' feature changed into 'invert selection' feature.

V0.9.1: 1997/08/25
------------------

'Select all' feature built in for the file selection window.

V0.9.0: 1997/08/22
------------------

This is the first 'working' version that can play mp3's in group in any random
order, etc. It's still not ready to be released because of lacking features that
make the program so much better than all those others :)
