V1.1.0: 1997/??/?? *yet to be completed*
==================

De code netjes maken, verdelen in C++ classes, interface mooier & gebruiks-
vriendelijker maken (meer kleur, status-balk benutten (o.a. pauze, etc) en
evt. zo maken dat het ook met FreeBSE werkt. En mixer-menuutje inbouwen.

V1.0.1: 1997/09/29
==================

The code for keyboard input handling has been changed. Effectively nothing
has been changed concerning the interface though. Soon however this new code
will allow the playlist that's currently being played to be shown on-screen
and it can be scrolled.

V1.0.0: 1997/09/07
==================

This is the very first version I considered worthy distributing. Most major
features I planned have actually be implemented now though there's still a
lot of room for improvement..but since I like to get opinions from other 
people who use it I released it. Some changes since the previous version:

-Loading a playlist now is possible, though it can only load it's own generated
 playlists. If you already have playlists that are nothing more than a list
 of filenames(+paths!) of *.mp3-files (mp2 not yet supported) then you can try
 to insert 1 line at the top of the file reading: "GROUPNAME: Default" 
 (without the double quotes).
-Problems with file-selection fixed. File-selection should be pretty reliable
 now.
-cosmetic bug-fixes (mostly text that could be written past a boundary)

V0.9.5.1: 1997/09/07
--------------------

Fixed a bug that caused selected items following a deleted item to shift up one
item.

V0.9.5: 1997/09/07
------------------

Added pageup/pagedown support for sw_window selection windows.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.4: 1997/09/04
------------------

Recursive file selection added.
Some minor bugfixes.

V0.9.3.1: 1997/09/01
--------------------

Directories are now alphabetically sorted.

V0.9.3: 1997/08/31
------------------

When you select files and change directory afterwards before adding the files
to the current group they won't be lost (as before) but stored and added to 
the group-window when you press F1(add files)

V0.9.2: 1997/08/26
------------------

'Select all' feature changed into 'invert selection' feature.

V0.9.1: 1997/08/25
------------------

'Select all' feature built in for the file selection window.

V0.9.0: 1997/08/22
------------------

This is the first 'working' version that can play mp3's in group in any random
order, etc. It's still not ready to be released because of lacking features that
make the program so much better than all those others :)
